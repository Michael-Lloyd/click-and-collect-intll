# Intuitionistic Linear Logic (ILL) Implementation Status

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the ILL-specific backend files, their current implementation status, and what needs to be completed for a fully functional ILL theorem prover.

## Overview

The ILL backend is designed as a parallel implementation to the existing Classical Linear Logic (LL) system. All ILL modules follow the same API structure as their LL counterparts, ensuring seamless integration with the existing frontend and routing infrastructure.

## File-by-File Implementation Status

### Core Data Structures

#### `ill_sequent.ml` - ✅ COMPLETE (Stubs)

- **✅ WORKING**: Single conclusion validation enforced
- **✅ WORKING**: ILL-specific error messages displayed to users

### Compilation Status - ✅ COMPLETE

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Logic Implementation (URGENT)
1. **`ill_apply_rule.ml`** - Implement rule application logic
2. **`ill_auto_prove_sequent.ml`** - Basic automated proving
3. Test basic ILL sequent proving capabilities

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (MEDIUM)
1. **`ill_focused_proof.ml`** - Focused proof search
2. **`ill_auto_reverse_sequent.ml`** - Reversible rules
3. Performance optimization and heuristics

### Phase 3: Validation and Testing (LOW)
1. Comprehensive test suite for ILL rules
2. Performance benchmarking against LL implementation
3. Frontend UI enhancements for ILL-specific features

## Key Differences from Classical Linear Logic

The ILL implementation must account for several key differences:

1. **No Structural Rules**: ILL lacks weakening and contraction
2. **Intuitionistic Implication**: Uses `⊸` (lollipop) instead of classical implication
3. **Resource Management**: Stricter linear resource usage
4. **Proof Search**: Different focusing strategies may be optimal

## Testing Requirements

Before the ILL implementation can be considered complete:

1. **Unit Tests**: Each ILL module needs comprehensive test coverage
2. **Integration Tests**: Full proof workflows from parsing to completion
3. **Comparison Tests**: Verify ILL behaves differently from LL where expected
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure ILL proving is efficient for practical use

## Current Limitations

- All proof search currently returns `ILL_Timeout` - no actual proving occurs
- Rule applications are not validated for ILL-specific constraints
- No performance optimization has been implemented
- ~~Error messages may not be ILL-specific enough~~ **FIXED**: ILL-specific error messages implemented

## Recent Achievements (Latest Implementation)

### ✅ Successfully Implemented Features:

1. **ILL Sequent Parsing (`/parse_sequent`)**:
   - Full validation of ILL-specific connectives (*, +, -o, 1, T)
   - Rejection of invalid LL connectives (⊥, 0, ^, ⅋, &, !, ?)
   - Single conclusion enforcement (critical ILL constraint)
   - User-friendly error messages for invalid input
   - Proper JSON response generation for frontend integration

2. **JSON Serialization Infrastructure**:
   - Complete ILL proof tree to JSON conversion
   - ILL sequent to raw sequent format conversion
   - Recursive handling of nested proof structures
   - Frontend-compatible JSON format

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Seamless routing via `intuitionisticMode` parameter
   - Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Display validation working correctly in proof interface

### ✅ Validated Functionality:
- Users can enter ILL sequents in the prove bar
- Valid ILL sequents (single conclusion) are accepted and displayed
- Invalid ILL sequents are rejected with specific error messages
- Invalid LL connectives are properly detected and rejected
- Multiple conclusions are rejected (enforcing ILL constraint)

## Files Ready for Implementation Work

The following files have complete frameworks and are ready for logic implementation:

1. `ill_apply_rule.ml` - Start here for manual rule application
2. `ill_auto_prove_sequent.ml` - Core automated proving logic
3. `ill_parse_sequent.ml` - May need ILL-specific parsing enhancements

The data structures (`ill_sequent.ml`, `ill_proof.ml`) and request handling (`ill_rule_request.ml`) are sufficiently complete to support development of the core logic.
