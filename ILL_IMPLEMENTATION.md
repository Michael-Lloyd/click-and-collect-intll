# Intuitionistic Linear Logic (ILL) Implementation Status

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the ILL-specific backend files, their current implementation status, and what needs to be completed for a fully functional ILL theorem prover.

## Overview

The ILL backend is designed as a parallel implementation to the existing Classical Linear Logic (LL) system. All ILL modules follow the same API structure as their LL counterparts, ensuring seamless integration with the existing frontend and routing infrastructure.

## Key Differences from Classical Linear Logic

The ILL implementation must account for several key differences:

1. **No Structural Rules**: ILL lacks weakening and contraction
2. **Intuitionistic Implication**: Uses `⊸` (lollipop) instead of classical implication
3. **Resource Management**: Stricter linear resource usage
4. **Proof Search**: Different focusing strategies may be optimal

## Testing Requirements

Before the ILL implementation can be considered complete:

1. **Unit Tests**: Each ILL module needs comprehensive test coverage
2. **Integration Tests**: Full proof workflows from parsing to completion
3. **Comparison Tests**: Verify ILL behaves differently from LL where expected
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure ILL proving is efficient for practical use

## Current Limitations

- All proof search currently returns `ILL_Timeout` - automated proving not yet implemented
- ~~Rule applications are not validated for ILL-specific constraints~~ **FIXED**: Complete rule validation implemented
- No performance optimization has been implemented yet
